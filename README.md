COMP 20 Spring 2014 Private Repo for Zach McGowan

My favorite assigment for this course was the 2048 gamecenter.  For me, this project provided
the greatest opportunity to grow and learn more about Web Development.

I am most proud of assignment 3: MBTA Map and Schedule Rodeo.  This project had a lot of moving
parts and was the most difficult for me to correctly implement.  However, when I did finally 
succeed, the gratification I felt made the struggle worth it.

Aside from Comp40, I think I have gained the most from this class in my 4 years at Tufts.
This class has provided me with the tools to not only be able to create cool web 
applications, but to explore other topics of web development that we didn't have 
time to cover in class.  This "teach a man to fish" quality that this class has
is a rare quality in college courses, in my opinion.
