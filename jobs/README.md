//Lab 6: Friends of Ming Chow Jobs Listing
//By: Zach McGowan, 2/27/14
//To my knowledge, all required parts of the lab are correctly implemented.
//All necessary JavaScript code is in the function parse() after the declaration
//of the object 'str'.  A stylesheet, 'jobs.css', has been included for 
//styling the title and table added to the page.
//Approximate time spent on lab: 2 hours
