To my knowledge, every aspect of this assignment has been correctly implemented.
I collaborated with Corey Ross and Ahmed Aly for this project.  Ahmed assisted me in
learning how to inject code via a jQuery post routine by pointing me to code snippets
from class.  Corey and I discussed ideas on hacking the 2048 gamecenter, most of which
he shared with the class at Ming's request.
I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
