Hey guys, I wanted to reach out to you all and make a plan to start on the project proposal and design doc.
For now we can use this README for communication, later we can turn it into something meaningful.

For reference my contact info is:
	email: zachary.mcgowan@tufts.edu
	phone#: 508-742-7567

I'm thinking we should meet in person this weekend so we can talk over what direction we want to go for this
project.  From there we could meet again if necessary and put in some time individually to put together
a good looking proposal and some wireframes.
If you could clone this, update it with your contact info and meeting time preference, and push, we could
come up with a time that works for all of us.

Zach-Sunday afternoon works best for me, but I am also free most of the day on Monday and Wednesday.

email: Ahmed.Aly@tufts.edu
number: 347-607-2424
I can meet sunday before 4pm.
