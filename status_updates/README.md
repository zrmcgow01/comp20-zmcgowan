This project is for lab 5 of Comp20.  In this lab, we use the <script>
feature to dynamically change a Web page.  The on change attribute is
used to take action when the enter key is pressed.  The action to 
be takenis to prepend a node with text that was entered into the text 
field, along with the date and time (exact formatting is specified 
in the lab assignment page).  This assignment was completed on 2/20/14.
